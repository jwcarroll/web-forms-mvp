            This is a collection of examples I have put together to help with the adoption of Agile engineering
    practices within a development team/department. Most of what you see here is just the re-iteration of
    advice that has been around long before Agile came about. However, it is no coincidence that the industry
    giants who gave us the <a href="http://agilemanifesto.org/">Agile Manifesto</a> are also strong advocates of these techniques and principles.
